Hi, I’m Patrick, a mechanical engineering student.
- My studies are currently exploring the applications of generative modelling to in multi-phase fluid flows of immiscible liquids for application in membraneless redox flow batteries.
- I’m currently learning to use scikit-learn, along with OpenFOAM and Docker.
- Interested in robotics, sustainability and addititive manufacturing
- I’m looking to collaborate on machine-learning projects applied in an engineering context.
